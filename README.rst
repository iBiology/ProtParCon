ProtParCon
==========

ProtParCon is an application framework for manipulating molecular data and
identifying parallel and convergent amino acid replacements at the
molecular level. Although ProtParCon was not designed for implementing new
methods or algorithms for molecular data manipulation, ProtParCon integrates
several widely used programs for multiple sequence alignment (MSA),
ancestral states reconstruction (ASR), protein sequence simulation,
Maximum-Likelihood tree inference (ML Tree) and molecular convergence
identification. Therefore, it can be used as a general tool to do MSA,
ASR, and simulation under a common interface by using various
pre-existed programs under hood.

Work-Flow of ProtParCon
=======================

ProtParCon processes a set of orthologous protein sequences with known
phylogenetic relationships in six stages:

- MSA
- ASR
- IDENTIFY
- SIM
- IDENTIFY,
- TEST

    Overview of the ProtParCon analytical scheme

During the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) stage, protein sequences are
aligned while gaps and ambiguous character states are trimmed.

In the ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) stage, ancestral character states at
each site are inferred for each internal node in the reconstructed tree.

Observed parallel and convergent amino acid replacements for pairs of branches
are identified in the IDENTIFY stage. Parallel replacements are denoted by P
(red) and convergent replacements by C (blue).

Simulations are conducted in the SIM (simulation) stage. Simulated sequences
are evolved according to the following parameters:

a. an evolutionary model (a replacement rate matrix)
b. the branching pattern and branch lengths of the tree estimated in the ASR
   stage
c. amino acid frequencies and sequence length estimated from the trimmed
   alignment.

Expected parallel and convergent replacements are identified after the SIM
stage or they are directly calculated if no simulation is conducted.

The differences between numbers of observed and expected parallel and
convergent replacements for branch pairs of interest are tested during the
TEST stage. For better readability, only part of simulated sequences and
detailed P&C data are shown. TSV (Tab Separated Values) format data are
reformatted. Notation of branch pair, A-B, means a branch pair involving two
branches that are leading to A and B, respectively. R1 and R2 represent two
amino acid replacement events along two branches. The standard one-letter
abbreviations for amino acids is used for the replacements.

Walk-through of an example
==========================

In order to show you what ProtParCon brings to the table, we'll walk you through
an example using the simplest way to identify parallel and convergent amino
acid replacements at the protein sequence level.

Here is the code for ProtParCon identifying parallel and convergent amino acid
replacements within an orthologous protein::

    from ProtParCon import imc

    sequence = 'path/to/the/orthologous/protein/sequence'
    tree = 'path/to/the/phylogenetic/tree'
    muscle = 'path/to/the/executable/of/muscle/alignment/program'
    codeml = 'path/to/the/executable/of/codeml/program'
    evolver = 'path/to/the/executable/of/evolver/program'

    imc(sequence, tree, aligner=muscle, ancestor=codeml, simulator=evolver)


Put the above code in a text file, name it something like `imc_analyze.py`
and run the script using Python in a terminal::

    $ python imc_analyze.py


Wait for this to finish you will have six files in your work directory:
`msa.fa`, `trimmed.msa.fa`, `ancestors.tsv`, `simulations.tsv`,
`imc.counts.tsv`, and `imc.details.tsv`. From their names, you may already know
what contents in these files. The `imc.counts.tsv` contains the number of
parallel and convergent amino acid replacements that have been identified among
all comparable branches, and it looks like this (reformatted here for better
readability)::

    Category    BranchPair    OBS  SIM-1  SIM-2  SIM-3  SIM-4  SIM-5
        P        A-B           0     0      1      1      0      1
        P        A-NODE10      0     0      0      0      0      0
        P        A-NODE11      3     2      1      0      3      2
        P        A-NODE13      0     2      0      1      0      2
        P        A-E           0     0      0      0      0      0
        C        A-B           0     2      1      2      2      0
        C        A-NODE10      0     0      0      0      0      0
        C        A-NODE11      0     0      0      1      1      0
        C        A-NODE13      0     0      1      2      0      1

The `imc.details.tsv` contains the details of parallel and convergent amino
acid replacements that have been identified, e.g. replacement occurred between
which branch pairs, on which position of the protein sequence, what kind of
replacement, and so on.


What just happened?
===================

When you run the script, ``imc()`` look for a sequence file and pass it
to a multiple sequence alignment program (`MUSCLE <www.drive5.com/muscle/>`_
program was used in this example), after done with the sequence alignment,
``imc()`` look for a phylogenetic tree file and pass it along with the
alignment (already removed all gaps and ambiguous characters) to a ancestral
sequence reconstruction program (``CODEML`` program inside
`PAML <http://web.mit.edu/6.891/www/lab/paml.html>`_ package is used) to
infer the ancestral states. Since a simulation program (``EVOLVER`` program
inside PAML package) is specified via argument simulator, ProtParCon will
automatically prepare all files needed by evolver and then use evolver to
conduct sequence simulation. Once ``imc()`` all these works are done, it will
start to identify parallel and convergent amino acid replacements along the
protein sequence and finally save the results to text files.

Here you notice that one of the main advantages about ProtParCon: sequence
alignment, ancestral states reconstruction, and sequence simulation are
automatically done without users calling each program step
by step. This means ProtParCon already have a pipeline that chained all these
processes together, users are only required to tell ProtParCon how they want
the sequence to be handled and what results they want to get. Another
advantage of using ProtParCon is that it provides a common interface for all
supported programs, users no longer need to learn how to use the program and
handle the results of these programs.

While ProtParCon enables users to do very fast parallel and convergent amino
acid replacement identifications (by use a single sequence file and a tree file)
, ProtParCon also gives users full control of the identification process through
explicitly manage the workflow step by step. Users are able to do things like
choosing preferred sequence alignment program to get high quality sequence
alignment, passing more parameters to ancestral states reconstruction program
to get accurate ancestral states, and getting full control of sequence
simulation process by explicitly using the simulation module with additional
options.


What else?
==========

You've seen how to run fast parallel and convergent amino acid replacement
identifications using general function ``imc()`` in ProtParCon package, but this
is just the surface. ProtParCon provides a lot of powerful features for
manipulating molecular data and makes parallelism and convergence
identification even phylogenetic analysis much easier and more efficient,
such as:

* Built-in support for a lot of sequence alignment programs for multiple
  sequence alignment (MSA) using simple function.

* Built-in support for a lot of phylogenetic tree inference programs for
  inferring best maximum likelihood tree using simple function.

* Built-in support for a lot of ancestral states reconstruction programs for
  ancestral states reconstruction (ASR) using simple function.

* Built-in support for a lot of sequence simulation programs for simulating
  sequences under various evolutionary scenarios using simple function.

* Built-in support for identifying parallel and convergent amino acid
  replacements using raw orthologous sequence, multiple sequence alignment,
  reconstructed ancestral sequences, or even simulated sequences.


What's next?
============

The next steps for you to do: install ProtParCon, follow through the pre-made
examples to learn how to unleash the full power of ProtParCon, use ProtParCon
in your routine work to ease the process of molecular data manipulation and
molecular parallelism and convergence identification, and finally extend
ProtParCon to make it support more and more programs if you are interested in
ProtParCon. Thanks for you interest!
