Before run any test, all the executables of programs that you are going to
use need to be set to their actual paths on your system accordingly, otherwise
tests that using these programs will be skipped.

If you want the test script do cleanup after testing, set True for CLEANUP,
then all the files and directories generated during testing will be removed
upon all tests finished.
